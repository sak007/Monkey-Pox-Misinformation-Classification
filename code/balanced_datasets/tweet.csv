@TwitttrJailBird @dotmarceo @NeedleTee @FoxNews I think people should ask for answers on the organon of covid because not only was there a lot of people saying this seemed man made and evidence it's especially weird how monkey pox magically showed up next as the new more dangerous variant I mean the facts,1
@Brian_Orak I think they are using monkeypox as an excuse to push masking for covid. It is always about covid.,1
@NewshubNationNZ @deborahjonesnz Annnddd monkeypox is here. And it is airborne. So mask up!,1
Great must watch episode!!! Pretty sure most Americans know this was a lab leak. Whether purposely or accidently is the question. Now they're manipulating monkey pox just in time for another election. How convenient for this corrupt administration. _URL_,1
"@MrJmuzz @NewshubNationNZ 9000-10,000 per day. 16 deaths per day. And Monkeypox - which is airborne - so MASK UP.",1
@GovernmentZA Then why keep telling us about this monkeypox? Just to be clear... We are not falling for any of this.,1
@KrutikaKuppalli @gabbystern @WHO I'm sure your staff has an excellent work ethic &amp; is putting in the work at impressive intensity right now.  The choices of @WHO leadership are questionable &amp; concerning. The covid and monkeypox pandemics are NOT being handled well. Avoiding airborne acknowledgement = not cool.,1
@KilValmer this is where i caught monkeypox from having gay sex,1
Ya'll cant have sex anyhow now that Monkeypox is going around :P,1
"@TonyHinton2016 SA and Portugal are ahead of us with their wave, it peaked and is falling without restrictions or bits of cloth, had little impact on anything. We should be the same, but yeah, fear is what they thrive on. They're not getting anywhere with Monkeypox so let's get covid going!",1
Just by the way it's spreading to non-endemic countries and it's ability to mutate. #monkeypox is a lab manipulated virus. #virus $SIGA _URL_,1

@fedup42Mn Lots of these things pop up and then disappear. Zika virus was another one. Monkey pox seems to have gone away and now they're talking about Marburg. I think these things are released in order to be tested and tweaked if necessary. Then saved up for when they need them.,1
So the Bilderbergers cancelled monkey pox? Did they decide their scam was too obvious this time?,1
"@TheCStevens @DebErelene @MerrimanEileen usual precautions do help as there is some evidence of an amount of airborne spread, however the main spread line is through fomites. Shared toilets, handshakes, hugs, touched product at supermarket, used and even washed sheets. Fastest spreading monkeypox in history by far",1
So they're pumping up the fear mongering on a new covid variant AND a monkey pox outbreak. Just in time for midterms this fall... At this point anyone buying into these scamdemics are complete fools.,1
